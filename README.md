# Kalimba Tabs

Rewrite of KalimbaLibre using Electron.

## Setup

After cloning the repo, in the root folder run:

`npm install`

## Dev

To run the program in development mode, run `npm run electron-pack` in the root folder.

### Things to Note:

- Development mode is unoptimised, so song playback will be much slower than it is in production mode

## Build

To make a build of the app, run `npm run electron-pack` in the root folder. It should show up in the `dist` folder when it's done
